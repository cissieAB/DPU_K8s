# Project Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Title
Cilium and Kind Networking Evaluation

---

## 2. Background & Motivation
Kubernetes networking is critical for service discovery, security, and performance. Cilium is a modern CNI that leverages eBPF for advanced networking, security, and observability. This project aims to evaluate Cilium's behavior and performance in a local Kind (Kubernetes-in-Docker) environment, with a focus on DNS resolution, network policies, and service connectivity.

---

## 3. Objectives
- Deploy a Kind cluster with Cilium as the CNI.
- Apply and test CiliumNetworkPolicy for DNS and application traffic.
- Benchmark network performance (e.g., wrk, iperf3).
- Document troubleshooting steps for common issues (e.g., DNS failures).

---

## 4. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The cluster must use Cilium as the only CNI.
- Application pods must be able to connect to each other by IP address.
- CiliumNetworkPolicy must be used to restrict and allow traffic (including DNS).
- Scripts must automate cluster setup, policy application, and performance testing.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- All setup and test scripts should be idempotent and runnable on a fresh Kind cluster.
- Documentation must be provided for setup, troubleshooting, and results.
- All manifests and scripts should be version-controlled.

---

## 5. Deliverables
- Automated setup scripts for Kind + Cilium + CoreDNS.
- Example application manifests (multi-tier app, wrk, iperf3).
- CiliumNetworkPolicy examples (including DNS egress).
- Performance test results and analysis.
- Troubleshooting guide for DNS and network policy issues.
- This PRD and a summary of findings.

---

## 6. Success Criteria
- All pods can resolve and connect to services via DNS.
- CiliumNetworkPolicy can selectively allow/deny traffic (including DNS).
- Performance benchmarks are reproducible.
- Documentation enables others to reproduce the setup and tests.
